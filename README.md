# Module Project: Component Side Effects- NASA APOD

This will be a two-module project. In it, you will consume the NASA API to fetch the "Astronomy Photo Of The Day" or APOD. Once you fetch the data, you will build a few components that will render different pieces of data in your interface. After the second module (in the [DAY_TWO_README.md](DAY_TWO_README.md) file) you will re-style your app using [Styled Components](https://github.com/BloomInstituteOfTechnology/nasa-photo-of-the-day.git).

## Instructions

---

Read these instructions carefully. Make sure you understand the requirements before starting this project.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. Doing so helps you and your team lead in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons.

## Introduction

In this project, you will build an application to show the NASA photo of the day. This is a fun project to show your family and friends when you've finished.

You will be starting from scratch and building the entire app. You don't have any design specs for this project, so it's advantageous to start by creating a basic wireframe first. Make it simple initially since you have yet to see the data you'll get back from NASA.

Once you get the data back, there may be more or less than expected, so your design plans may change. That's totally fine and very normal in the real world. Just make the proper adjustments and move forward!

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

This project was put together using create-react-app (CRA). You will not need to install CRA to make this project work. Follow the steps below to set up the project with the proper dependencies.

- [ ] Clone the repository to your machine using your terminal.
- [ ] Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ] Start up the app using `npm start`
- [ ] Implement the project on the `main` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin main`

### Task 2: MVP

**Planning**

- [ ] If you want, this is the time to make a simple design spec (look up ["simple wireframes"](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+wireframes) to find resources & examples). **A pen & paper sketch (or outline) is often the fastest way to start your planning.**
- [ ] Once you have a design plan, break down the designs into individual components.
- [ ] Plan which components will hold state, what data each needs from props (if any), and where you will make your data fetch.
- [ ] Now it's time to jump into the code!

**File structure**

- [ ] Take a look at your planned components. Create the folders and files you need for each component.
- [ ] Leave most of them blank for now - you need to get your data from the API before you can get these built.

**Fetching the Data**

- [x] In `App.js` (or where ever you want to fetch the data), add state for the data you'll get from NASA.
- [x] Add an effect hook to handle the API call side effect.
- [ ] Go to the [NASA APOD API docs](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) and read through the docs to see how to make the API call.
- [ ] You don't _need_ an API key. However, you may need one if you exceed the API request limits.
- [x] Using the endpoint given, fetch the data using `axios`.
- [x] In your `.then()`, make sure to `console.log` the response so you can look at the shape of the data. ðŸ˜ƒ
- [x] Before you add your data to state, make sure your effect hook has a dependency array (probably empty since we don't want this effect synced up to any state/props). Failing to do so will start an **infinite loop, and you will exceed the API rate limits of the DEMO_KEY and need to use a real API_KEY.**

DEMO KEY rate limits:

> Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour

> Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

_Note: if the photo url is NOT a photo, you will need to learn how to display a video in a React app on your own, OR fetch the APOD from a different date by adding this to the back of the API endpoint: `&date=2012-03-14`_

**Adding the Data to State**

- [x] Once you have made the call correctly, and logged the data, add the data to the state property you built.

**Display the Data**

Now is the time to build out your other components. Compose your UI, then pass the data to your children components via props so you can render it on the DOM.

#### _MVP Requirements:_

- [ ] Use the effect hook to fetch the APOD data when the component mounts.
- [ ] Display the APOD data in different components that are composed together to build your UI.

#### Pro Tips

You may run into an error where your components try to access object properties before your app fetches the data - ie. `Cannot read property 'url' of undefined`. This means that the data you passed as props is undefined when you were expecting it to be an object. You can fix this by simply adding something like this to any component that needs to read data from your state object:

```js
// Display a loading message while the data is fetching
if (!props.photoOfTheDay) return <h3>Loading...</h3>;

// Display your component as normal after the data has been fetched
return (
  {/* your normal JSX here */}
);
```

Read through the API docs carefully. As a developer, you will read through many technical docs, so start now to try and understand them.

### Task 3: Stretch

Only attempt stretch problems once you've completed the MVP and made the final commit.

- [ ] Notice the optional query param `date`? You can pass a different date in your url like this `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2012-03-14` to get the APOD from a different date. Add a date dropdown that allows you to select a different date and see that APOD. This will be a lot of work, but it will be a fantastic exercise to go through a little more complicated logic and interaction in your app. This is also a very common type of interaction, so it would be good to try this out
- [ ] Make another app that consumes another one of NASA's other APIs listed on the same website

## Submission Format

Follow these steps to complete your project.

- [ ] Submit a link to your repository in Canvas.
